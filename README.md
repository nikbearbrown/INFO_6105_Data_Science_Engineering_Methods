# INFO 6105  Data Science Engineering Methods  (Computational Biology Emphasis) 

# Course Overview

This course introduces the core concepts of machine learning with a unique emphasis on computational biology. It covers all foundational topics typically addressed in an introductory machine learning course, but with a twist: all examples and case studies are rooted in biology and medicine. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of various machine learning algorithms, their implementation, evaluation, and best practices, focusing on how learning models are formulated from intricate data pipelines.

## Topics Include

- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks, deep learning).
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems).

All case studies and real-world examples draw from biological and medical datasets, allowing students to apply machine learning techniques to relevant challenges in the fields of biology and medicine.

**Practical Skills**: The ability to use Python is part of the grade. Students must demonstrate the ability to set up data for learning, train, test, and evaluation using Python or R, with all assignment examples and solutions presented in Python.

## Course Components

- Assignments include paper exercises designed to reinforce conceptual understanding.
- Quizzes and exams.
- A term project is required.
- A portfolio blog is required.
