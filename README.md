# INFO 6105  Data Science Engineering Methods  (Computational Biology Emphasis) 

# Course Overview

This course introduces the core concepts of machine learning with a unique emphasis on computational biology. It covers all foundational topics typically addressed in an introductory machine learning course, but with a twist: all examples and case studies are rooted in biology and medicine. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of various machine learning algorithms, their implementation, evaluation, and best practices, focusing on how learning models are formulated from intricate data pipelines.

## Topics Include

- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks, deep learning).
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems).

All case studies and real-world examples draw from biological and medical datasets, allowing students to apply machine learning techniques to relevant challenges in the fields of biology and medicine.

**Practical Skills**: The ability to use Python is part of the grade. Students must demonstrate the ability to set up data for learning, train, test, and evaluation using Python or R, with all assignment examples and solutions presented in Python.

## Course Components

- Assignments include paper exercises designed to reinforce conceptual understanding.
- Quizzes and exams.
- A term project is required.
- A portfolio blog is required.

## Learn Data Science

The programming languages _Python_ and _R_ dominate data science. For visualization, _Vega_, _Vega-Lite_, and _D3_ are excellent languages.

### Step 1: Programming

To start with data science, learning programming languages such as Python and R is essential. Here are some resources to get you started:

- [Python for Data Science](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
